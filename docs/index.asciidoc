==== Description

The logstash-input-splunk plugin is a custom Logstash input plugin that enables direct ingestion of data from Splunk into Logstash. It was developed to bridge the gap between Splunk and the ELK stack, allowing users to unify their logging pipelines and perform deeper analysis using Elasticsearch and Kibana.

This plugin supports Splunk's REST API for searching and exporting events, making it easier to extract data based on time ranges or specific queries. It is ideal for organizations migrating from Splunk, combining it with ELK, or needing hybrid log analysis.

Designed with flexibility and performance in mind, this plugin is fully configurable and compatible with Logstash pipelines.
